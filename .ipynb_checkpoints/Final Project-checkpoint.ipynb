    "The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is a subdepartment in the United States Department of Education that collects data on a variety of factors that relate to civil rights of students, including student characteristics like race and gender, intances of bullying, retention rates, and much more. This data is collected at a school-wide level; each school reports the data to the OCR.\n",
    "    \n",
    "This tutorial will explore the OCR's <a href=\"https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/civil-rights-data-collection-2013-14\">Civil Rights Data Collection dataset</a> for the 2013-2014 school year. My goal is to understand which factors correlate strongest with high school retention rates (i.e., the rate at which students are required to repeat a grade). In addition, I will make a model that allows us to predict retention rates based on these factors. Because education policy is so different from state to state, I will analyze this at a state level. (Education policy is also very different on a district to district level, but there are more than 13,000 school districts, some with very few schools, so I felt that doing it at the state level was a nice middle ground.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For those interested in education policy, this will be an insightful tutorial into both how education data analysis is done at a broad level and into potential policy alternatives that may mitigate the factors that correlate to high school retention. Reducing high school retention rates is incredibly important, as it allows students to enter the workforce faster. It is especially important for low-income students whose families may be relying on them to begin working sooner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the data collected is not part of a randomized-control trial study (RCT), we cannot be sure that reducing any of the factors that correlate with high school retention rates will result in a reduction of high school retention rates. However, this tutorial may give insight into which factors would be worth researching further in an RCT or quasi-experimental study.\n",
    "</p>\n",

    "<h4>Further background readings</h4>\n",
    "<p>Before we get started, here are some quick and easily-digestable articles on the effect that retention in high school has on students.\n",

    "</ul>\n",
    "In addition, here are some articles about the use of physical and mental punishment in schools. This will be important in the next section, because the majority of the independent variables I choose have to do with punishment.\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/us/corporal-punishment-school-tennessee.html\">In 19 States, It's Still Legal to Spank Children in Public Schools</a></li>\n",

This is important, because it will allow me to filter out schools that aren't high schools (i.e. schools that do not have students in all and only grades 9-12). I also kept columns that determined if a school was a juvenile, special education, charter, magnet, or \"alternative\" school, because I wanted to remove any schools that are marked as one of these — I am focusing on traditional public high schools.

For those states, we can conclude that at least from the data available we cannot predict to a statistically significant extent the number of retentions per student based on independent variables we have chosen. For the others, we can conclude that we can significantly predict this.</p>"

    "<p>The Office for Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Education collects an insane amount of civil rights-related data. Beyond the data I've analyzed in this tutorial, this data is further disaggregated by race, ethnicity, gender, disability status, and more. There is a lot more data analysis that could be done just on this dataset with regards to retention and punishment within U.S. schools.</p>\n",
    "<p>One key insight from this tutorial is that the state (and likely the school district) that you're analyzing matters. As is common in education policy, this project cannot provide insights at a local district level, which is often the level that most education policy decisions are done and implemented. The best recommendation I can provide is to follow the methods I've used in this tutorial and examine your own school district. Maybe you'll find some interesting correlations that can help drive local policy recommendations.</p>\n",
    "<p>I hope you enjoyed following along with this tutorial. Data analysis in education policy is a massive field that has barely been uncovered and if you're interested in exploring it further I highly recommend looking into open positions and internships at the variety of education policy thinktanks around the United States.</p>"
